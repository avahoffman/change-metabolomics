How do shortgrass prairie plants respond holistically to nitrogen pollution?

This project aimed to detect metabolomic and trait (physiology like photosynthetic rate) responses to nitrogen in shortgrass steppe grasslands.

(Project in progress)

Quantifying plant communities' responses to excess nitrogen provides better predictions of the effects of climate and human land use change. Plant communities in dry ecosystems are often dominated by few species whose responses to nitrogen may play a key role in such community responses. 

In order to determine the role of dominant species in community nitrogen response, we quantified metabolomes and physiological traits in the dominant grass *Bouteloua gracilis* and a dominant forb *Sphaeralcea coccinea*. We expected these responses would vary strongly between species and would change with increasing nitrogen and that these responses would lead to strong causal linkages between species and community. Species diverged strongly across the metabolome, with glycan-related compounds more prevalent in *B. gracilis* and flavones and coumarins more abundant in *S. coccinea*. Approximately 9% of metabolites also differed according to nitrogen treatment. Intercellular CO2 differed between the two species, but surprisingly, most physiological traits were resistant to nitrogen addition. Increased nitrogen was linked to decreases in *B. gracilis* cover and acted directly on the community and not through dominant species traits we measured. 

This could indicate that biotic interactions and species turnover in the shortgrass steppe are key to understanding nitrogen response. Thus, despite apparent resistance to nitrogen addition by the dominant species in this ecosystem, this community may still be vulnerable to shifts caused by increased nitrogen deposition and accumulation.
